# Telos Benchmarks

This repository contains benchmark results and evaluation data for Telos, an experimental AI architecture built from scratch in Go.

Telos is a personal research project exploring alternatives to conventional neural network architectures. The code is not currently public.

## Available Benchmarks

### ProofWriter
A standard reasoning benchmark evaluating logical inference and deduction capabilities.

- [proofwriter-results.csv](./proofwriter-results.csv) — Raw evaluation results

## About Telos

Telos (Greek: purpose) is designed to run on constrained hardware—CPU only, limited RAM, no GPU—as a self-imposed architectural constraint.

Early results include:
- 400/400 random mazes solved optimally after training on a single maze (9999x9999 cells, 3x3 view)
- 26 cognitive benchmarks passed, covering analogical reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-correction

More benchmarks and documentation will be added as testing continues.
